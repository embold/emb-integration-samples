/**
 * A specialized {@link BackgroundInitializer} implementation that can deal with
 * multiple background initialization tasks.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class has a similar purpose as {@link BackgroundInitializer}. However,
 * it is not limited to a single background initialization task. Rather it
 * manages an arbitrary number of {@link BackgroundInitializer} objects,
 * executes them, and waits until they are completely initialized. This is
 * useful for applications that have to perform multiple initialization tasks
 * that can run in parallel (i.e. that do not depend on each other). This class
 * takes care about the management of an {@link ExecutorService} and shares it
 * with the {@link BackgroundInitializer} objects it is responsible for; so the
 * using application need not bother with these details.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The typical usage scenario for {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} is as
 * follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a new instance of the class. Optionally pass in a pre-configured
 * {@link ExecutorService}. Alternatively {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} can
 * create a temporary {@link ExecutorService} and delete it after initialization
 * is complete.</li>
 * <li>Create specialized {@link BackgroundInitializer} objects for the
 * initialization tasks to be performed and add them to the {@code
 * MultiBackgroundInitializer} using the
 * {@link #addInitializer(String, BackgroundInitializer)} method.</li>
 * <li>After all initializers have been added, call the {@link #start()} method.
 * </li>
 * <li>When access to the result objects produced by the {@code
 * BackgroundInitializer} objects is needed call the {@link #get()} method. The
 * object returned here provides access to all result objects created during
 * initialization. It also stores information about exceptions that have
 * occurred.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} starts a special controller task that
 * starts all {@link BackgroundInitializer} objects added to the instance.
 * Before the an initializer is started it is checked whether this initializer
 * already has an {@link ExecutorService} set. If this is the case, this {@code
 * ExecutorService} is used for running the background task. Otherwise the
 * current {@link ExecutorService} of this {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} is
 * shared with the initializer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The easiest way of using this class is to let it deal with the management of
 * an {@link ExecutorService} itself: If no external {@link ExecutorService} is
 * provided, the class creates a temporary {@link ExecutorService} (that is
 * capable of executing all background tasks in parallel) and destroys it at the
 * end of background processing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively an external {@link ExecutorService} can be provided - either at
 * construction time or later by calling the
 * {@link #setExternalExecutor(ExecutorService)} method. In this case all
 * background tasks are scheduled at this external {@link ExecutorService}.
 * <strong>Important note:</strong> When using an external {@code
 * ExecutorService} be sure that the number of threads managed by the service is
 * large enough. Otherwise a deadlock can happen! This is the case in the
 * following scenario: {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} starts a task that
 * starts all registered {@link BackgroundInitializer} objects and waits for
 * their completion. If for instance a single threaded {@link ExecutorService}
 * is used, none of the background tasks can be executed, and the task created
 * by {@link MultiBackgroundInitializer} waits forever.
 * </p>
