/**
 * A specialized implementation of the {@link ConcurrentInitializer} interface
 * based on an {@link AtomicReference} variable.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class maintains a member field of type {@link AtomicReference}. It
 * implements the following algorithm to create and initialize an object in its
 * {@link #get()} method:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>First it is checked whether the {@link AtomicReference} variable contains
 * already a value. If this is the case, the value is directly returned.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise the {@link #initialize()} method is called. This method must be
 * defined in concrete subclasses to actually create the managed object.</li>
 * <li>After the object was created by {@link #initialize()} it is checked
 * whether the {@link AtomicReference} variable is still undefined. This has to
 * be done because in the meantime another thread may have initialized the
 * object. If the reference is still empty, the newly created object is stored
 * in it and returned by this method.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise the value stored in the {@link AtomicReference} is returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Because atomic variables are used this class does not need any
 * synchronization. So there is no danger of deadlock, and access to the managed
 * object is efficient. However, if multiple threads access the {@code
 * AtomicInitializer} object before it has been initialized almost at the same
 * time, it can happen that {@link #initialize()} is called multiple times. The
 * algorithm outlined above guarantees that {@link #get()} always returns the
 * same object though.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Compared with the {@link LazyInitializer} class, this class can be more
 * efficient because it does not need synchronization. The drawback is that the
 * {@link #initialize()} method can be called multiple times which may be
 * problematic if the creation of the managed object is expensive. As a rule of
 * thumb this initializer implementation is preferable if there are not too many
 * threads involved and the probability that multiple threads access an
 * uninitialized object is small. If there is high parallelism,
 * {@link LazyInitializer} is more appropriate.
 * </p>
