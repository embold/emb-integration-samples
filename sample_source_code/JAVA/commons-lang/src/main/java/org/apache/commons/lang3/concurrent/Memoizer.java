/**
 * Definition of an interface for a wrapper around a calculation that takes a single parameter and returns a result. The
 * results for the calculation will be cached for future requests.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is not a fully functional cache, there is no way of limiting or removing results once they have been generated.
 * However, it is possible to get the implementation to regenerate the result for a given parameter, if an error was
 * thrown during the previous calculation, by setting the option during the construction of the class. If this is not
 * set the class will return the cached exception.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thanks go to Brian Goetz, Tim Peierls and the members of JCP JSR-166 Expert Group for coming up with the
 * original implementation of the class. It was also published within Java Concurrency in Practice as a sample.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <I> the type of the input to the calculation
 * @param <O> the type of the output of the calculation
 * @since 3.6
