/**
 * This class provides a generic implementation of the lazy initialization pattern.
 *
 * <p>
 * Sometimes an application has to deal with an object only under certain circumstances, e.g. when the user selects a specific menu item or if a special event
 * is received. If the creation of the object is costly or the consumption of memory or other system resources is significant, it may make sense to defer the
 * creation of this object until it is really needed. This is a use case for the lazy initialization pattern.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This abstract base class provides an implementation of the double-check idiom for an instance field as discussed in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java", 2nd
 * edition, item 71. The class already implements all necessary synchronization. A concrete subclass has to implement the {@code initialize()} method, which
 * actually creates the wrapped data object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As an usage example consider that we have a class {@code ComplexObject} whose instantiation is a complex operation. In order to apply lazy initialization to
 * this class, a subclass of {@link LazyInitializer} has to be created:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class ComplexObjectInitializer extends LazyInitializer<ComplexObject> {
 *     &#064;Override
 *     protected ComplexObject initialize() {
 *         return new ComplexObject();
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Access to the data object is provided through the {@code get()} method. So, code that wants to obtain the {@code ComplexObject} instance would simply look
 * like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create an instance of the lazy initializer
 * ComplexObjectInitializer initializer = new ComplexObjectInitializer();
 * ...
 * // When the object is actually needed:
 * ComplexObject cobj = initializer.get();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * If multiple threads call the {@code get()} method when the object has not yet been created, they are blocked until initialization completes. The algorithm
 * guarantees that only a single instance of the wrapped object class is created, which is passed to all callers. Once initialized, calls to the {@code get()}
 * method are pretty fast because no synchronization is needed (only an access to a <strong>volatile</strong> member field).
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.0
 * @param <T> the type of the object managed by the initializer.
